# model_explain/explainers/surrogate.py

"""
This module implements a surrogate model explainer using a decision tree classifier.
The surrogate model approximates the predictions of a more complex model, providing
a simpler and more interpretable representation of its decision-making process.

Goal: Train interpretable surrogate model to mimic complex model predictions.

Features:
- Uses DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
- Fits the surrogate model on the predictions of the complex model.
